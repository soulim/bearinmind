# Bear in mind

Bear in mind is a card game created together with my son Tim.

## Rules

The objective of the game is to collect the highest score.

### Preparation

- Mix and spread cards face-side-down on a flat surface.
- Decide on who goes first.
  For example, the youngest player starts the game.

### Game play

Players take turns flipping two cards face-side-up.
The cards **must be** turned over completely, so that other players case see them.

The turn evaluation:

- It's *a miss* if cards turned face-side-up are not identical.
  In that case a player flips those cards face-side-down again, in the same place.

  The turn ends and the next player begins.

- It's *a match* if cards turned face-side-up are identical.

  When open cards belong to a complete group (a full duplet/triplet/quartet), the player takes these cards.
  Taken cards will score points at the end of the game.
  Because the player found a match they are allowed to turn two more cards.
  This continues until the player fails to find a match.

  When open cards belong to incomplete group (a triplet/quartet), the player has to decide whether to take open cards a match or to risk and open one more card to possibly complete the group and score more points.

  If the player decides to take open cards as a match, they are allowed to turn two more cards.
  This continues until the player fails to find a match.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If a decision to take open cards as a match leads to a situation when only one card of a group left unopened, that card becomes *an obstacle*.
  > When later someone opens an obstacle card, the turn ends and the card goes out of the game.

  If the player decides to risk and open one more card, the turn evaluation starts again.

### End of the game

The game ends when there are no unopened cards left.

All players sum up how many points they have for each match collected during the game.
Matches has different value:

- a duplet: 2 points
- a triplet: 5 points
- a quartet: 10 points

The player with the highest score wins the game.
